# Introduction

Welcome to the first part of my multi-part series on virtualization-based obfuscators. I've recently been fascinated by the complexity of these software protection solutions, so I spent my summer studying the architecture, internals, and functionality of some of the most popular virtualization-based obfuscators out there. I was able to do this research through a summer internship with the SEFCOM Lab at Arizona State University; I greatly appreciate their support and funding. 
<br /><br />
To give a quick introduction to the topic, software virtualization (and obfuscation in general) is generally the largest barrier to entry for any software reverse engineer. It is frequently used by both good and bad actors to protect their software from the peering eyes of reverse engineers. Because of this, I hope that these write-ups not only serve to assist in the de-obfuscation of these protections but also help to improve the quality of them in the future. I also hope that these write-ups help inspire future research and innovation in the field of software obfuscation as it is as important as it is obscure. With all that out of the way, let's dive into the write-up.

# Setup

Tigress is the first virtualization-based obfuscator I wanted to start with because it is simple, accessible, and free. This obfuscator was primarily developed by Christian Collberg at the University of Arizona for research purposes. To start analyzing Tigress, I needed to install the obfuscator and create a sample binary to analyze. While the source code for Tigress seems to be fairly hard to get ahold of, the pre-compiled binaries can be downloaded by just about anyone. After downloading the binaries from [here](https://tigress.wtf/download.html) on a Linux machine, some light setup needs to be done. The home directory for Tigress needs to be set in the TIGRESS_HOME environment variable and added to the *PATH* variable as well. Instructions for this can be found in the *INSTALL* file included with the binaries. Tigress differs from most software virtualizers due to the fact that it's a source obfuscator. Instead of taking a pre-compiled binary as input, it instead uses the C source code of the program you wish to virtualize. Not only does it do that, but it also gives you the virtualized source code of the program after it's been obfuscated. I chose one of the sample programs included with Tigress---test1.c---to begin experimenting with. The original source code for *test1.c* can be seen below.

```c
void fac(int n) {
  int s=1;
  int i;
  for (i=2; i<=n; i++) {
    s *= i;
  }
  printf("fac(%i)=%i\n",n,s);
}

void fib(int n) {
  int a=0;
  int b=1;
  int s=1;

  int i;
  for (i=1; i<n; i++) {
    s=a+b;
    a=b;
    b=s;
  }
  printf("fib(%i)=%i\n",n,s);
}

int main (int argc, char** argv) {
  fac(1);
  fib(1);
  fac(5);
  fib(5);
  fac(10);
  fib(10);
  return 0;
}
```
As you can see, the *fib* function prints the *n*th Fibonacci number while the *fac* function prints the factorial of *n*. Now that I had a sample program, it was time to obfuscate it using Tigress. The final command I used can be found below.

```m
tigress \--Environment=x86\_:Linux:Gcc:4.6 
        \--Transform=Virtualize \--Functions=fib,fac \--out=test1_out.c test1.c
```

Let me quickly explain the parameters I chose here. The first two parameters are fairly self-explanatory; I wanted the binary to be compiled for Linux in x86 using GCC. There are other options available such as ARM and Clang, but I just wanted a standard Linux x86 binary to analyze. The next parameter specifies the transformations to apply to the binary. Since I'm mainly focused on the virtualization techniques of these obfuscators, I will only select that option for now, but I may investigate the other forms of obfuscation in a future write-up as [Tigress has many](https://tigress.wtf/transformations.html). The next parameter lets you indicate which functions you'd like to virtualize. I chose the two main functions in the test program: *fib* and *fac*. The final parameter just lets you specify the file name for the obfuscated source code. After running the command, Tigress spits out two files: *test1_out.c* and *a.out*. The first file is the virtualized version of the programs source code and the second file is the compiled version of the virtualized program (compiled with GCC, as specified). Now that I had an obfuscated binary, it was time to load it into IDA Pro and get started with the analysis.

# Analysis

<p class="caption">The *main* function of *test1* in IDA</p>

Starting with the *main* function in IDA, it looked fairly normal. There's no obfuscation to be seen on the surface, so I decided to keep digging. A function that caught my eye from the start was *megaInit*. I assumed that it was going to be some sort of initialization function for Tigress, but opening it in IDA didn't reveal too much.

<p class="caption">The *megaInit* function of *test1* in IDA</p>

<p class="caption">Source code for the *megaInit* function in VSCode</p>

This function seemed to do absolutely nothing. Looking at the obfuscated source code (*test1_out.c*), I started to understand why. It was literally a blank function. While this function may not be used in Tigress for the virtualization transformation, it may be used for any of the other ones. Either way, I decided to ignore it. The next function to investigate is *fac,* the factorial function that I discussed earlier. This was one of the functions I selected to be virtualized while obfuscating the binary.

![](/blog/tigress/image23.png)

<p class="caption">The fac function in IDA</p>

Taking a quick look at this function, there is clearly something strange happening here. A small factorial function that was only 6 lines in the original source code has been expanded into a monstrous function with hundreds of conditional branches. We can assume that the virtualization-based obfuscation from Tigress had done its job.

## VM Entry

![](/blog/tigress/image16.png)

<p class="caption">The entry point of the fac function</p>

When analyzing virtual machines (or most software for that matter), it's usually a good idea to begin analysis at the start of the function and work your way down to the complex parts. I started analyzing the virtual machine entry point for *fac* and found plenty of information about the virtual machine just by looking there. Starting in the first block, the inputted number for the function *n* is moved into *rbp-0x144*. I named this location on the stack *inputNumber*. This instruction also shows that Tigress is using the stack to store local variables for virtual machine context (and accessing them relative to the stack frame, *rbp*). After this, I looked towards the bottom of the first block. I wanted to find the location of the bytecode for the virtual machine. Since symbols weren't stripped for this binary, it's pretty easy to spot where it is. A pointer to data labeled *\_1_fac\_\$array* is moved into *rax*. This register now stores a pointer to the start of the virtualized bytecode. Directly afterward, a *mov* instruction transfers this address to the stack variable *rbp-0x138*. This variable is now (fairly obviously) the virtual instruction pointer, so I named it *instructionPointer*. All of this incredibly useful information was gathered just by briefly looking over the entry point.

## Virtual Stack

My next step was figuring out how the virtual stack was implemented by Tigress. Looking at the stack variables created in the entry point of the VM, there are *0x100* bytes allocated on the stack at *rbp-130h*. This immediately caught my attention as it seemed like an appropriate size for a stack. Also, a pointer to this location gets loaded into *rbp-140h* when the VM was initialized which is very likely a virtual stack pointer. Since there are no other large variables in the entry point, I started to assume that this was our stack. To confirm it, I needed to look at how *rbp-140h* was being used by the VM.

![](/blog/tigress/image20.png)

<p class="caption">An opcode routine that heavily utilizes [rbp-140h]</p>

To find out if this space was our stack, I decided to find an opcode routine that utilizes it. At the very start of the routine (shown above), the *instructionPointer* variable is being incremented by 1, meaning that my assumption was correct about this being the virtual instruction pointer. Since the instruction pointer was only incremented by 1, this is grabbing the byte after the opcode. This is likely an operand attached to the instruction that is used by the opcode handler. Afterward, *rbp-140h* is moved into a register, incremented by 8, and the operand is pushed onto the stack. After this completes, the stack pointer is incremented by 8 again, the *instructionPointer* is incremented by 4, and the virtual machine continues to the next instruction. From this routine, we can also see that the size of a standard instruction in this VM is 5 bytes: 1 byte for the opcode, then 4 bytes for an operand. Some of the instructions only use 1 byte as they don't need an operand, but I'll talk about that later. Also, since I've now confirmed that *rbp-140h* is the virtual stack pointer, I'll rename the variable to *stackPointer.*
<br /><br />
One aspect of the virtual stack that is slightly unique is how it increments the stack pointer to push elements onto the stack instead of decrementing the pointer like a normal stack. This also means that the stack grows down instead of growing up like a normal stack. This doesn't change the functionality/usability of the stack in any way, but it's still cool to observe how the Tigress developers decided to implement it. 

## Local Variable Space
There is one more part of the virtual machine that confused me initially. Declared at the entry point, there is some space saved on the stack at *rbp-30h*. This seems to be a 32-byte space that is only used in one or two of the opcode routines. I needed to investigate these routines to see what they could possibly be used for.

![](/blog/tigress/image31.png)

<p class="caption">A routine that uses the variable at [rbp-30h]</p>

In this routine, it seems like 3 separate values are pulled out of this data space and loaded into registers. After this, the values are fed into *printf*. The only other instruction that uses *rbp-30h* pushes pointers to locations in the space into the stack. Through some assumptions, I concluded that *rbp-30h* is where local variables are stored. From now on, I'll refer to *rbp-30h* as *localVariableSpace.* I found this out by using the IDA debugger and looking at the values that are fed into *printf*. Referring to the original function, *\[localVariableSpace+0x10\]* is the *"fac(%i)=%i\\n"* string, *\[localVariableSpace+0x18\]* is *n*, and *\[localVariableSpace+0x1C\]* is *s*.

## Dispatch

Now that I understood the virtual stack and local variable implementation, it was time to start analyzing the flow of the VM. After everything is initialized and the VM is ready to start executing, we get to the dispatch handler (shown below).

![](/blog/tigress/dispatch.png)

As you can see, this is an extremely simple dispatch handler. It mainly consists of long *cmp* chains that match an opcode to its specific handler. There's unfortunately not much more to talk about here. This is an incredibly simple dispatcher that leads directly to the opcode handlers with no further obfuscations. Now that we know this, let's look at the opcode handlers that this dispatcher uses.

## Opcodes

![](/blog/tigress/image18.png)

<p class="caption">All of the opcodes for fac</p>

Now that I was starting to understand the overall flow of the VM, I decided to start analyzing the individual opcode routines. I could count about 15 just by looking at the graph view, so I knew it wasn't going to be very difficult. Since the opcode routines are fairly boring to analyze, I'll save you the hassle and list out what each opcode does in the table below. Note that some of the instructions are only 1 byte in size because they do not require extra operands for their functionality. This is very similar to [x86 machine code in that sense](http://www.c-jump.com/CIS77/CPU/x86/lecture.html); each instruction can be a different size based on the need for extra parameters.

| Opcode |   Size  |                                             Behavior                                            |                 Implementation                 |
|:------:|:-------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------:|

|  0x3A  |  1 Byte |                   Moves a value on the stack into its same location (useless)                   |                  \[SP\] = \[SP\]               |

|  0x5A  |  1 Byte |                                             VM Exit                                             |                      retn                      |
|  0x5B  | 5 Bytes |                                     Instruction pointer jump                                    |                  IP += \[OPERAND\]             |
|  0x64  | 5 Bytes |                         Pushes a pointer to a local variable onto stack                         |           \[SP + 1\] = LV + \[OPERAND\]        |
|  0x67  |  1 Byte |                                 Loads from an address on the stack                              |               \[SP\] = \[\[SP\]\]              |
|  0x7B  | 5 Bytes |                  Pushes a pointer to a string in a string table onto the stack                  |     \[SP + 1\] = StringTablePtr + \[OPERAND\]  |
|  0x84  | 5 Bytes |                       Pushes an IV from instruction operand onto stack                          |               \[SP + 1\] = \[IP\]              |
|  0x88  |  1 Byte |                              Compares (<=) two values on the stack                              |         \[SP -1\] = \[SP - 1\] <= \[SP\]       |
|  0x9A  | 5 Bytes | Jump to offset address from instruction parameters if value on stack is true (conditional jump) |          if \[SPv]:<br>IP += \[OPERAND\]       |
|  0xA3  |  1 Byte |                     Stores 8-byte value on the stack into a pointer on stack                    |        \[\[SP\]\] = \[SP - 1\]<br>SP -= 2      |
|  0xBE  |  1 Byte |                                Multiplies two values on the stack                               |        \[SP - 1\] = \[SP - 1\] ✕ \[SP\]        |

One thing that is interesting about Tigress is its opcode randomization. In the other function that I virtualized inside this binary, *fib*, the instruction set is completely different. If I had to guess, Tigress has a preset amount of instruction implementations that it assigns to random opcodes while virtualizing a function. After it has its randomized instruction set, it likely just translates the x86 code directly. This is a simple yet effective implementation for these types of randomized architectures.

## Instruction Trace

After I was done classifying all of the instructions, I started to analyze the actual virtualized program. I wanted to see how it utilized the virtual instructions to calculate a factorial the same way the original binary would. Similar to gathering info on the opcodes, this process is incredibly boring, so I'll just put all of the instructions in a table below as usual.

| Instruction # | Opcode |    Operand Bytes    |                                Explanation                               |

For this instruction trace, I made the mistake of recording the trace for the very first call of the *fac* function: *fac(1)*. This means that the factorial calculation code never actually runs, but I could still analyze it statically. For this reason, instructions 16-29 are all theoretical as I never observed the execution of them (the factorial of 1 is just one, obviously). It's still fairly easy to see how the virtualized bytecode relates back to the original program. We can see that local variable *0x4* is very likely the *s* variable (in the original code) and that local variable *0x8* is the *i* variable for the loop. We can also see that local variables *0x10*, *0x18*, and *0x1c* are used as parameters for *printf*, which explains why local variable *0x4* gets moved into local variable *0x1C* near the end of execution. This also explains why the string table value is loaded into local variable *0x10* as the first parameter to *printf* is always going to be the main string. With the loop code, it's fairly easy to see how this correlates to the original source code as well. It simply loads the value of *0x4* and *0x8* onto the virtual stack (variables *s* and *i*) and multiplies them together continuously until *i* equals *n*. All of these functionalities are extremely similar to their implementations in x86, so it seems like these virtual instructions are a direct conversion from x86 (like I guessed earlier).

# Conclusion

Tigress is a standard & simple virtualization-based obfuscator that is a great introduction into the inner workings of virtual machines. It uses a stack for most of its operations, a separate space for local variables, and implements instructions with simple, consistent routines. Since Tigress uses C source code as its input and output, it will likely be fairly different from most other virtualization-based obfuscators which use pre-compiled binaries as input and output. I am interested to see how they all differ in functionality and effectiveness. Even though there are almost no defining features that make Tigress difficult to reverse, the VM would likely be much more complex if I enabled more settings while obfuscating the binary. Even then, I'm sure that I'll get my fair share of complexity when I reverse some commercial  obfuscators in the near future. Wrapping it up, the clean architecture of Tigress was great practice for future projects and I'm glad that I took the time to analyze it.
