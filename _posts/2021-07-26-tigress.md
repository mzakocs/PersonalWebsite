Tigress is the first virtualization-based obfuscator I'm taking a look
at. It was primarily developed by Christian Collberg at the University
of Arizona for research purposes and seems to be fairly complex. I
started analyzing Tigress by installing the obfuscator and creating a
sample binary to analyze. While the source code for Tigress seems to be
fairly hard to get a hold of, the pre-compiled binaries can be
downloaded by just about anyone. After downloading the binaries from
[[here]{.ul}](https://tigress.wtf/download.html), some light setup needs
to be done. The home directory for Tigress needs to be set in the
TIGRESS_HOME environment variable and added to PATH as well.
Instructions for this can be found in the INSTALL file included with the
Tigress binaries. After this, getting a C file obfuscated is fairly
simple. I used one of the sample programs included with
Tigress---test1.c---to start with. This is the command I used to create
my binary:

```sh
tigress \--Environment=x86\_:Linux:Gcc:4.6 \--Transform=Virtualize
\--Functions=fib,fac \--out=test1_out.c test1.c
```

I'll first explain the parameters I chose. The first parameter is fairly
obvious; I wanted the binary to be compiled in x86\_ for Linux and for
it to compile the program using GCC. There are other options available
such as ARM and Clang, but I just wanted a standard x86 binary to
analyze. The second parameter specifies the transformations to apply to
the binary. Since this document is mainly focused on the virtualization
techniques of these obfuscators, I will only select that option for now.
I may investigate the other forms of obfuscation that Tigress implements
in the future, [as it has
many](https://tigress.wtf/transformations.html), but I'll stick
with analyzing the virtual machine for now. The third parameter lets you
indicate which functions you'd like to virtualize. I chose the two main
functions in the test program: *fib* and *fac*. The *fib* function
returns the *n*th Fibonacci number, and the *fac* function returns the
factorial of *n*. After running the command, we get two output files:
*test1_out.c* and *a.out*. The first file is the program's obfuscated
source code and the second file is the final compiled version of the
obfuscated program. We now have a binary to load into IDA and start
analyzing. From now on, I'll refer to this obfuscated binary as *test1*.

While I do have access to the obfuscated source code of *test1*, I will
be analyzing the binary in IDA Pro and only referring to the source code
when needed. IDA's graph view makes it much easier to visualize the
virtual machine in action (and looks much nicer in pictures).

The *main* function of *test1* in IDA

Looking at the *main* function in IDA, it looks fairly normal. There's
no obfuscation to be seen on the surface, so let's keep digging. The
first function I wanted to investigate was *megaInit*. I assumed it was
some sort of initialization function for Tigress, but opening it in IDA
didn't reveal too much.

Source code for the *megaInit* function in VSCode

This function seemed to do absolutely nothing. Looking at the source
code, it made a little more sense. This is literally a blank function.
While this function may not be used in Tigress for the virtualization
transformation, it may be used for the other ones. In any case, I'll
ignore it for now. The next function to investigate is *fac,* the
factorial function that we saw in the original *test1* program. This was
one of the functions I selected to be virtualized when obfuscating the
binary with Tigress.

The *fac* function in IDA

Taking a quick look at this function, we can see that there is something
strange happening here. A small factorial function that was only 6 lines
in the original source code has been expanded into a monstrous function
with hundreds of conditional branches. We can assume that the
virtualization-based obfuscation from Tigress had done its job.

The entry point of the *fac* function

I started by analyzing the virtual machine entry point for *fac*. We can
find plenty of information about the virtual machine just by looking at
this portion. Starting in the first block, the inputted number for the
function *n* is moved into *\[rbp-0x144\]*. I named this location on the
stack *inputNumber*. After this, I looked towards the bottom of the
first block. I wanted to find the location where the virtualized
bytecode was stored. Since symbols weren't stripped for this binary,
it's pretty easy to see where it is. A pointer to the data
*\_1_fac\_\$array* is moved into *rax.* This register now stores a
pointer to the start of the virtualized bytecode. Directly after, a
*mov* instruction transfers this address to *\[rbp-0x138\]*. This
location on the stack is (fairly obviously) the instruction
pointer/counter, so I named the variable *instructionPointer*. These
were two pieces of information that I could gather about the VM just by
briefly looking over the entry point.

My next step was figuring out how the stack of the virtual machine was
implemented by Tigress. Looking at the variables created on the stack at
the entry point of the VM, there are 0x100 bytes allocated on the stack
at *\[rbp-130h\]*. This immediately caught my attention, as this seems
like an appropriate size for a stack. Also, a pointer to this location
gets loaded into *\[rbp-140h\]* at the VM entry point*,* which is very
likely our stack pointer*.* Since there are no other large variables in
the entry point, I started to assume that this was our stack. To confirm
it, I needed to look at how *\[rbp-140h\]* was being used by the VM.

An opcode routine that heavily utilizes the stack

I decided to start looking at some of the opcode routines. This would
give me insight into how these stack variables were being used. At the
very start of this routine, the *instructionPointer* variable is being
incremented by 1, meaning that my assumption was likely correct about
this being the counter. Since the instruction pointer was only
incremented by 1, this is grabbing the byte after the opcode. This is
likely some sort of parameter or data that is needed by this opcode.
Afterward, *\[rbp-140h\]* is moved into a register, incremented by 8,
and the data from the instruction pointer is pushed onto the stack.
After this completes, the stack pointer is incremented by 8 again, the
*instructionPointer* is incremented by 4, and the virtual machine
continues to the next instruction. From this routine, we can also see
that the size of a standard instruction in this VM is 5 bytes: 1 byte
for the opcode, then 4 bytes for data. Some of the instructions only use
1 byte as they don't need the extra data section, but I'll talk about
those later. Also, since we now know that *\[rbp-140h\]* is the stack
pointer, I'll rename the variable to *stackPointer.*

There is one more part of the virtual machine that is fairly obscure.
Declared at the entry point, there is some space saved on the stack at
*\[rbp-30h\]*. This seems to be a 32-byte space that is only used in one
or two of the opcode routines. I needed to investigate these routines to
see what they could possibly be used for.

A routine that uses the variable at *\[rbp-30h\]*

In this routine, it seems like 3 separate values are pulled out of this
data space and loaded into registers. After this, the values are fed
into *printf*. The only other instruction that uses *\[rbp-30h\]* pushes
pointers to locations in the space into the stack. Through some
assumptions, I concluded that *\[rbp-30h\]* is where local variables are
stored. From now on, I'll refer to *\[rbp-30h\]* as
*localVariableSpace.* I found this out by using the IDA debugger and
looking at the values that are fed into *printf*. Referring to the
original function, *\[localVariableSpace+0x10\]* is the
*"fac(%i)=%i\\n"* string, *\[localVariableSpace+0x18\]* is *n*, and
*\[localVariableSpace+0x1C\]* is *s*.

All of the opcodes for *fac*

Now that I finally knew how the VM worked, I started to analyze the
individual opcode routines. By looking at the instruction array for
*fac* and by looking at the IDA graph, I could count about 15. Since the
routines are fairly boring to analyze, I'll save you the hassle and list
out what each opcode does in the table below. Note that some of the
instructions are only 1 byte in size because they do not require
parameters or extra data in their routine.

Something that initially confused me about the dispatcher is that some
of the opcode routines have no direct conditional branches to them. I
discovered that any opcode greater than 0x5A uses a separate dispatcher
that calculates an arbitrary dynamic address for the location of the
routine instead of using a hardcoded *jmp* like the rest of the opcodes.
This likely happened because 0x5A is the VM Exit instruction so the
compiler got confused and did some very strange optimizations.
Nonetheless, I ignored this secondary dispatcher and simply used dynamic
analysis to trace the opcodes that lead to the isolated routines. In the
future, I'll remember to disable compiler optimizations on GCC to avoid
issues like this.

Overall, Tigress seems to implement a fairly simple virtual machine. It
uses a stack for most of its operations, uses a separate space for local
variables, and has simple opcodes that lead to consistent routines.
Since Tigress uses source code for input and output, it will likely be
very different from Themida and VMProtect who both use pre-compiled
binaries as input and output. It will be interesting to see the
differences in assumptions and implementations between the different
obfuscators.
